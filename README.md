# Flood-Fill-Diagrams:  A Haskell scanline stack flood-fill algorithm implementation

## Introduction

**Flood-Fill-Diagrams** is a software tool for generating 2D grid images that display the scanline-stack flood-fill algorithm.

## Purpose

Flood-fill algorithms are used heavily in graphics programming and painting programs.  Haskell is a wonderful language, but not often used to solve these kinds of problems.

Implementing an efficient scanline-stack based flood-fill algorithm would be an interesting way to apply Haskell to this problem domain, and see what kind of performance is achievable using a purely functional language.
